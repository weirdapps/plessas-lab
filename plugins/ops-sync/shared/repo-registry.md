**Repo visibility is deliberately not recorded here.** It is mutable and
safety-relevant (the PII-gauntlet rule depends on it), and a hand-maintained
copy of it drifted to nine wrong rows, every one understating public exposure.
Read it live instead: `gh repo list weirdapps --json name,visibility`.
